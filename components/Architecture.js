            <strong>Smart Contracts:</strong> Deployed on Binance Smart Chain, the contracts handle token
            staking, market resolution, reward distribution, and governance logic.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Market Engine:</strong> Markets are created with YES/NO outcomes tied to verifiable events
            (e.g. BTC price targets, macro events). Winnings are distributed based on outcome and stake size.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Oracles:</strong> Initially semi-centralized for beta launch, with plans to transition to
            a decentralized oracle network (e.g. Chainlink or UMA) for trustless resolution.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Frontend & API:</strong> Built using React, Next.js, and Supabase â€” ensuring real-time data,
            seamless UX, and decentralized publishing of prediction feeds.
